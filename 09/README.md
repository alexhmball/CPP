# Module 09 - STL

Module 09 of the C++ course focuses on the Standard Template Library (STL). The STL is a powerful collection of C++ classes and functions that provide various data structures and algorithms for efficient programming. This module explores the use of STL containers, algorithms, and iterators to manipulate data effectively.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout Module 09, I accomplished the following learning outcomes:

- Created a program btc that reads bitcoin prices from a database and calculates the value of bitcoin on a specific date provided as input.
- Developed a program RPN (Reverse Polish Notation) that evaluates mathematical expressions provided in reverse polish notation and outputs the result.
- Implemented a program PmergeMe that uses the merge-insert sort algorithm to sort a positive integer sequence and measures the time taken by different containers for the sorting process.

## Key Concepts Covered
Module 09 covered the following key concepts:

- Reading and parsing data from files: Utilizing file I/O to read and parse data from CSV and text files.
- Using STL containers: Implementing STL containers such as std::vector to store and manage data efficiently.
- Utilizing STL algorithms: Applying STL algorithms like sorting to process data effectively.
- Handling errors and exceptions: Implementing error handling to gracefully handle invalid input and edge cases.

## Reflection
Module 09 introduced me to the powerful capabilities of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++. The btc program demonstrated how to read and process data from files, along with using STL containers to organize and search for specific values. The RPN program showcased the use of STL containers and algorithms to evaluate mathematical expressions in reverse polish notation, providing a deeper understanding of the STL's flexibility and functionality.

The most challenging exercise was PmergeMe, which involved implementing the merge-insert sort algorithm and measuring its performance using different STL containers. This exercise provided valuable insights into sorting algorithms and the impact of container choice on the performance of the algorithm.

Overall, Module 09 provided hands-on experience with STL containers, algorithms, and iterators, enhancing my proficiency in C++ programming. I am excited to utilize these skills in real-world projects and continue exploring the vast capabilities of the STL.
