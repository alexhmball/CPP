# Module 03 - C++ Inheritance

Module 03 of the C++ course explores the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming. Inheritance allows us to create new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base classes). This mechanism facilitates code reuse, promotes hierarchical relationships, and enables polymorphism, which is a powerful feature of OOP.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout Module 03, I accomplished the following learning outcomes:

- Learned about inheritance in C++, understanding how to create derived classes that inherit properties and behaviors from base classes.
- Implemented a base class called ClapTrap, showcasing the use of constructors, destructors, and member functions to perform various actions.
- Developed derived classes, ScavTrap and FragTrap, inheriting from the ClapTrap class with their specialized attributes and functions.
- Explored constructor and destructor chaining, ensuring proper object initialization and destruction.
- Gained insights into the Diamond Problem and how to resolve it by using virtual inheritance.

## Key Concepts Covered
Module 03 covered the following key concepts:

- Inheritance and derived classes
- Constructors and destructors in derived classes
- Constructor and destructor chaining
- Virtual inheritance and the Diamond Problem

## Reflection
Module 03 provided a comprehensive understanding of inheritance, a crucial aspect of object-oriented programming. Creating derived classes from existing base classes allowed me to reuse code effectively and maintain a hierarchical relationship between classes.

The implementation of the ClapTrap, ScavTrap, and FragTrap classes demonstrated how constructors and destructors work in both base and derived classes, showing the importance of constructor and destructor chaining to ensure proper object initialization and destruction.

Learning about virtual inheritance and the Diamond Problem added another layer of complexity to the class hierarchy. The DiamondTrap class showcased how to resolve ambiguity when a class inherits from multiple base classes using virtual inheritance.

Overall, Module 03 expanded my understanding of object-oriented programming and how to design classes in a way that promotes code reusability and maintainability. I look forward to applying these concepts to more complex projects and exploring advanced topics in the upcoming modules. The C++ journey has been both challenging and rewarding, and I'm excited to continue learning and honing my skills as a C++ developer.
