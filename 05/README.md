# Module 05 - Repetition and Exceptions

Module 05 of the C++ course focuses on repetition and exceptions. In this module, we explore the concepts of exceptions, error handling, and how to implement abstract classes. Additionally, we delve into using inheritance to create different types of forms that bureaucrats can handle in a bureaucratic system.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout Module 05, I accomplished the following learning outcomes:

- Gained an understanding of exception handling and how to define and throw custom exceptions.
- Implemented an abstract class called AForm to serve as the base class for different types of forms.
- Developed concrete classes such as ShrubberyCreationForm, RobotomyRequestForm, and PresidentialPardonForm that inherit from AForm, each with its own unique behavior and requirements.
- Implemented the execute member function for each concrete class to perform their respective actions when executed by a bureaucrat.
- Implemented the Intern class, which has the capability to create and return different types of forms based on the provided form name and target.

## Key Concepts Covered
Module 05 covered the following key concepts:

- Exception handling and custom exception classes
- Abstract classes and pure virtual functions
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Implementing concrete classes with unique behavior
- Encapsulation and access control in classes

## Reflection
Module 05 introduced me to the crucial concept of exception handling and the significance of using custom exception classes to provide meaningful error messages when exceptional situations occur during program execution. By implementing abstract classes and concrete classes inheriting from them, I learned how to design and organize class hierarchies to enable code reuse and maintainability.

The creation of various forms, such as ShrubberyCreationForm, RobotomyRequestForm, and PresidentialPardonForm, showcased how polymorphism allows objects of different derived classes to be treated as objects of the common base class, making the code more flexible and adaptable.

The implementation of the Intern class demonstrated how to use class member functions to create objects and handle dynamic memory allocation, returning appropriate pointers based on the given input.

Overall, Module 05 enhanced my understanding of C++ programming techniques and equipped me with essential tools for handling errors gracefully and designing efficient and organized class hierarchies. I look forward to applying these concepts in more complex projects and continuing my journey to becoming a proficient C++ developer.
