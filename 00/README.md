# Module 00 - First Steps in C++

In Module 00 of the C++ course, I embarked on an exciting learning journey to explore the world of C++ programming. Throughout this module, I focused on mastering the basics of C++ and gaining a solid understanding of essential concepts that form the foundation of the language.

## Learning Outcomes
During this module, I achieved the following learning outcomes:

- Gained knowledge about namespaces, classes, and member functions, allowing me to organize my code more effectively and make it more modular.
- Understood initialization lists, static, and const, which helped me control the behavior of my classes and variables, making my code more efficient and robust.
- Learned about memory management, avoiding memory leaks, and ensuring proper deallocation of memory, enhancing the reliability of my code.
- Embraced the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) while designing the PhoneBook and Contact classes, making my code more organized and easier to maintain.
- Adhered to coding standards and compiler flags, ensuring that my code was clean, readable, and compatible with the C++98 standard.
- Effectively utilized the standard library to simplify my code and improve its performance.
- Embraced curiosity and sought to understand theoretical concepts, enriching my learning experience and appreciation for the language's capabilities.
