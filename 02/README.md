# Module 02 - C++ Ad-hoc Polymorphism and Operator Overloading

Module 02 of the C++ course delved into ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading, and the Orthodox Canonical class form. These concepts build upon the foundational knowledge from Module 01 and enable more sophisticated and expressive C++ programming techniques.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout Module 02, I accomplished the following learning outcomes:

- Developed a deeper understanding of ad-hoc polymorphism, allowing me to create functions that can operate on different data types in a seamless and flexible manner.
- Mastered operator overloading, enabling me to define custom behaviors for C++ operators to work with user-defined data types like classes.
- Implemented classes in the Orthodox Canonical Form, adhering to a specific set of rules for consistent and maintainable class design.
- Successfully designed a fixed-point number class, demonstrating how to represent fractional values with a fixed number of bits.
- Utilized constructors to initialize objects from different data types and conversions between them.
- Overloaded comparison and arithmetic operators to perform operations on fixed-point numbers naturally.
- Implemented pre-increment, post-increment, pre-decrement, and post-decrement operators for more intuitive interactions with fixed-point numbers.
- Created static member functions to find the minimum and maximum values among fixed-point numbers.

## Key Concepts Covered
Module 02 covered the following key concepts:

- polymorphism
- Operator overloading
- Orthodox Canonical class form
- Constructors and conversions
- Overloaded comparison and arithmetic operators
- Increment and decrement operators
- Static member functions

## Reflection
Module 02 was an exciting continuation of my journey through C++ programming. Ad-hoc polymorphism and operator overloading have opened up new possibilities for designing versatile and user-friendly classes. I gained a deeper understanding of customizing operators to fit the needs of my classes, making code more expressive and natural.

The implementation of the fixed-point number class was particularly enlightening, showcasing how C++ allows us to create user-defined types that behave like built-in data types. Overloading the comparison and arithmetic operators for the fixed-point class gave me a glimpse of the power of operator overloading in C++.

The Orthodox Canonical class form has become an integral part of my class design process, ensuring consistency and maintainability in my codebase. Splitting class code into header and source files helped me organize my code effectively and promote modularity.

I'm eager to apply the knowledge gained in Module 02 to more complex projects and explore additional aspects of C++ programming in the upcoming modules. The journey so far has been challenging but immensely rewarding, and I'm excited to continue learning and growing as a C++ developer.
