# C++ Modules

This README provides a summary of the C++ modules covered in the course. Each module focuses on different aspects of C++ programming, including basic syntax, object-oriented programming, templates, and the Standard Template Library (STL). Throughout the modules, I gained a comprehensive understanding of C++ concepts and practical experience with various programming techniques.

## Module 00: Introduction to C++
Module 00 served as an introduction to C++ programming. It covered the basics of C++ syntax, variables, data types, and control structures such as loops and conditionals. The module also introduced the concept of functions and the use of headers and source files. Exercises included creating simple programs to demonstrate comprehension of the covered topics.

## Module 01: Memory Allocation, References, and Pointers
Module 01 delved into memory allocation in C++, covering stack and heap memory, pointers, and references. It explained the differences between these memory management techniques and their implications in programming. Exercises involved dynamic memory allocation, pointer arithmetic, and the use of references in functions.

## Module 02: Ad-hoc Polymorphism, Operators Overloading, and Canonical Class Form
Module 02 explored ad-hoc polymorphism in C++ through operator overloading. It explained how to define custom behavior for operators when working with user-defined classes. Additionally, the module emphasized the importance of following the Orthodox Canonical Form when designing classes. Exercises included overloading operators for custom classes and implementing canonical class forms.

## Module 03: Inheritance
Module 03 focused on object-oriented programming concepts such as inheritance and polymorphism. It introduced inheritance hierarchies and the use of base and derived classes. The module also covered virtual functions and pure virtual functions to achieve runtime polymorphism. Exercises included creating class hierarchies and implementing virtual functions.

## Module 04: Subtype Polymorphism, Abstract Classes, Interfaces
Module 04 continued exploring polymorphism, focusing on subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces. It explained the use of abstract classes and interfaces to create generalized behavior and ensure contract adherence. Exercises involved implementing abstract classes and interfaces to solve programming problems.

## Module 05: C++ Casts and Exceptions
Module 05 introduced C++ type casts, including static_cast, dynamic_cast, const_cast, and reinterpret_cast. It explained when and how to use these casts safely and appropriately. The module also covered exception handling in C++ and the use of try-catch blocks to handle errors gracefully. Exercises included implementing various casts and handling exceptions in code.

## Module 06: C++ Templates
Module 06 focused on C++ templates, a powerful feature that enables generic programming. It covered function templates and class templates, allowing for the creation of versatile and reusable code. The module also explained template specialization and partial template specialization for specific cases. Exercises involved creating generic functions and classes using templates.

## Module 07: C++ STL Iterators, Algorithms, and Containers
Module 07 explored the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++, specifically iterators, algorithms, and containers. It introduced the various STL containers like vector, list, and map, along with the associated iterators and algorithms for data manipulation. Exercises included using STL containers, iterators, and algorithms to solve programming problems.

## Module 08: C++ Templated Containers, Iterators, Algorithms
Module 08 continued the exploration of C++ templated containers, iterators, and algorithms. It emphasized the importance of using modern C++ features while complying with the C++98 standard. Exercises involved implementing templated functions and classes, as well as utilizing STL containers and algorithms.

## Module 09: C++ STL
Module 09 focused exclusively on the Standard Template Library (STL). It covered reading data from files, utilizing STL containers, and applying STL algorithms to solve programming tasks. Exercises included processing data from files, evaluating mathematical expressions, and sorting sequences using STL containers and algorithms.

### Conclusion
The C++ modules provided a comprehensive journey through the fundamentals and advanced features of the C++ programming language. I gained valuable knowledge and practical experience in writing efficient and reusable C++ code, enabling me to tackle diverse programming challenges with confidence.
