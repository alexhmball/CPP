# Module 07 - C++ Templates

Module 07 of the C++ course focuses on C++ templates. In this module, we explore function templates and class templates, which allow us to create generic functions and classes that can work with different data types.

## Learning Outcomes
Throughout Module 07, I accomplished the following learning outcomes:

- Implemented function templates for swap, min, and max functions that can work with any type of argument and support all comparison operators.
- Developed a function template iter that takes an array, its length, and a function as parameters and applies the function to every element of the array.
- Created a class template Array to represent arrays of elements of type T and implemented various functionalities, including constructors, copy, assignment, subscript operator, and a size member function.

## Key Concepts Covered
Module 07 covered the following key concepts:

- Function templates: Creating generic functions that can work with multiple data types.
- Class templates: Creating generic classes that can work with different types.
- Generic programming: Writing code that can handle various data types without duplicating code for each type.
- Template specialization: Providing special implementations for specific types when needed.

## Reflection
Module 07 introduced me to the power of C++ templates, which allows for generic programming and code reusability. The implementation of function templates for swap, min, and max demonstrated how to create functions that work with any type of argument and support comparison operators.

The iter function template showcased how to apply a function to every element of an array, regardless of its data type. This functionality provided a convenient way to perform operations on arrays without duplicating code for different types.

The creation of the Array class template showed how to build a generic container class that can hold elements of any type. The class template supported various functionalities commonly associated with arrays, such as subscript access and size calculation.

Overall, Module 07 provided valuable insights into C++ templates and generic programming. The understanding gained from this module will be instrumental in developing flexible and reusable code in C++. I look forward to applying these concepts in real-world projects and further improving my C++ programming skills.
